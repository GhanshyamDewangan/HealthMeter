# 🩺 HealthMeter App

**HealthMeter** is an Android application that helps users calculate their **BMI (Body Mass Index)** using height and weight inputs in different units (cm/inch & kg/lbs).  
It also categorizes the BMI result (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) and gives motivational messages.  
All records are stored in **Firebase Realtime Database**, and users can view their BMI history and trends.
